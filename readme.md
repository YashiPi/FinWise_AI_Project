# FinWise - AI Voice Assistant Enabled Banking Application

## Summary

This project is a banking application that integrates an AI voice assistant, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Python/Flask for voice interaction. It enables users to manage their finances through features like account management, goal tracking, budgeting, and micro-investments. The application utilizes an AI agent for command interpretation and tool invocation.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **Account Management:** View account details, track expenses, and visualize financial data through charts and graphs.
- **Goal Tracking:** Future goal-setting with expenditure and savingsÂ analysis, monitor progress with visual progress bars, and categorize goals.
- **Budget Management:** Add transactions, round amounts to manage savings, and view transaction history by day, week, or month.
- **Micro-investments:** Track savings and allocate funds for various investment categories.
- **AI Voice Assistant:**
  - Voice-activated interaction using the Web Speech API.
  - AI Agent for command interpretation and tool invocation (LangChain and Groq API).
  - Voice command interpretation for navigation and data management.
  - Text-to-Speech feedback.
- **Data Persistence:** MongoDB for secure and efficient data storage.
